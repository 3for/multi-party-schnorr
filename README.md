Threshold Schnorr signatures
=====================================
Currently supporting two protocols: 
* Aggragated Signatures:  {n,n} scheme based on [simple_schnorr_multi_signatures_with_applications_to_bitcoin](https://github.com/KZen-networks/multi-party-schnorr/blob/master/papers/simple_schnorr_multi_signatures_with_applications_to_bitcoin.pdf) and the scheme for discrete-logs (section 5) from [compact_multi_signatures_for_smaller_blockchains](https://github.com/KZen-networks/multi-party-schnorr/blob/master/papers/compact_multi_signatures_for_smaller_blockchains.pdf) 
* Multi-signature scheme based on  Micali-Ohta-Reyzin: [Accountable-Subgroup Multisignatures](https://github.com/KZen-networks/multi-party-schnorr/blob/master/papers/accountable_subgroups_multisignatures.pdf). This code is being used currently in: https://github.com/KZen-networks/kms-secp256k1 for 2p-Schnor key management.

The implementations are _bip-schnorr_ compatible (https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki)

Disclaimer: (1) This code should not be used for production at the moment. (2) This code is not secure against side-channel attacks
